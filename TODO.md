STATES CHECK FOR ID -1 TO SEE IF LIST IS EMPTY OR NOT BUT OTHER STATES GO TO STATES WITH DEFAULT VALUE 0 SO THE STATE WILL BE TREATED AS NOT BEING EMPTY EVEN THOUGH IT IS. THIS ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE FIXED BY MAKING THE CALLING STATE CHECK THE SIZE OF THE LIST BEFORE SWITCHING STATE. STATES SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON EACH OTHER THIS WAY.
